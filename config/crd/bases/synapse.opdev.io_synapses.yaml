                          from. \n When we need to fetch a signing key, each server
                          is tried in parallel. \n Normally, the connection to the
                          key server is validated via TLS certificates. Additional
                          security can be provided by configuring a `verify key`,
                          which will make synapse check that the response is signed
                          by that key. \n This setting supercedes an older setting
                          named `perspectives`. The old format is still supported
                          for backwards-compatibility, but it is deprecated. \n 'trustedKeyServers'
                          defaults to matrix.org, but using it will generate a warning
                          on start-up. To suppress this warning, set 'surpressKeyServerWarning'
                          to true. \n Options for each entry in the list include:
                          \n    serverName: the name of the server. required. \n    verifyKeys:
                          an optional map from key id to base64-encoded public key.
                          \n       If specified, we will check that the response is
                          signed by at least \n       one of the given keys. \n    acceptKeysInsecurely:
                          a boolean. Normally, if `verify_keys` is unset, \n       and
                          federation_verify_certificates is not `true`, synapse will
                          refuse \n       to start, because this would allow anyone
                          who can spoof DNS responses \n       to masquerade as the
                          trusted key server. If you know what you are doing \n       and
                          are sure that your network environment provides a secure
                          connection \n       to the key server, you can set this
                          to `true` to override this \n       behaviour. \n An example
                          configuration might look like: \n trustedKeyServers: \n
                          \  - serverName: my_trusted_server.example.com \n     verifyKeys:
